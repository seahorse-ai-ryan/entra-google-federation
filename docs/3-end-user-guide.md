## **First-Time Sign-In Steps**

1.  **Power On and Connect:**
    *   Unbox your new laptop, plug it in, and power it on.
    *   Proceed through the initial screens (language, keyboard layout) until you are prompted to connect to a network.
    *   Connect to your home or office Wi-Fi.

2.  **Choose Account Type:**
    *   On the "How would you like to set up this device?" screen, you **must** select **"Set up for work or school"**.

3.  **Sign In with Your Google Account:**
    *   When prompted to sign in, enter your full Google Workspace email address (e.g., `<your-name>@<your-domain.com>`).
    *   Windows will automatically redirect you to the familiar Google sign-in page.
    *   Enter your Google password and complete any two-factor authentication steps (like a code from your phone).

4.  **Windows Setup:**
    *   Once you've authenticated with Google, you'll be returned to the Windows setup process.
    *   Follow the remaining on-screen prompts (like setting up a PIN) to finish.

5.  **Done!**
    *   Windows will prepare your desktop. All of your company's applications and settings will be installed automatically in the background.

## **Troubleshooting**

*   **I see a Microsoft password reset screen.**
    *   This means the redirect to Google didn't work. Click "Back" and re-enter your full email address. Ensure you are typing it correctly. If the problem persists, contact IT.
*   **I get an error that my user account doesn't exist.**
    *   This is a temporary issue where your account hasn't finished syncing. Please wait 10-15 minutes and try again. If you still can't log in, contact IT.
*   **My laptop has Windows Home.**
    *   This setup only works with Windows Pro. Please contact IT for assistance with upgrading your device.
