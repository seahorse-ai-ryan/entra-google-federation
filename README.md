# Entra ↔ Google Federation Toolkit

PowerShell scripts and documentation for Zero-Touch Windows provisioning using Google Workspace as the identity provider.

## What This Does

Enables users to sign into new Windows laptops with their Google Workspace credentials during Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE), without requiring local IT support.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Drop-ship compatible (international users can self-provision)
- ✅ Single sign-on with Google Workspace
- ✅ Automated application deployment via Winget (Windows Package Manager)
- ✅ **Free** - No recurring per-user licensing costs (no Intune required)
- ✅ Reusable for multiple domains

## How It Works

1. **Federation:** Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD's successor - the cloud identity service for Windows) trusts Google Workspace for authentication
2. **Why Entra?** Without Entra federation, Windows requires a Microsoft account or local account - you cannot sign in with Google credentials. Entra is **free** for basic usage like this. See our [deployment strategy](docs/deployment-strategy.md) for alternatives and why we chose this approach.
3. **Provisioning:** User accounts automatically sync from Google Workspace to Entra (SCIM)
4. **OOBE:** Users sign in with Google credentials during Windows setup
5. **Apps:** PowerShell scripts install organization-specific applications via Winget

## Requirements

### **Google Workspace**
- **Business Plus, Enterprise Standard, or Enterprise Plus license**
  - Business Starter/Standard: Does NOT support SAML SSO ❌
  - Business Plus or higher: Supports SAML SSO ✅
  - Free and non-profit tiers: Not supported
- Custom domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`)
- Super Admin access to Google Workspace console

### **Microsoft Entra ID (Free)**
- **No paid subscription required** - Entra federation is completely free
- Global Administrator access
- **Why needed:** Enables Windows Pro devices to use Google credentials for sign-in

### **DNS Access**
- Ability to add CNAME records to your domain's DNS
- Required for Windows device enrollment (see admin setup guide)

### **Windows Devices**
- **Windows 11 Pro** (Home can be upgraded during OOBE, but it's technical - see docs)
- **TPM 2.0 chip** (included in all laptops from 2016+, built-in security hardware)

### **For Administrators**
- PowerShell 7.0+ (for running setup scripts)

## Use Cases

This toolkit is ideal for:
- Small to medium organizations (5-50 devices)
- Remote/distributed teams
- Cost-sensitive organizations avoiding Intune
- Drop-ship laptop deployments
